**Chatbot Flow Builder** is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) App router project to build a flows using Drag and Drop. It uses [Reactflow](https://reactflow.dev/) and [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)

Additionally this application is capable of auto-saving current flow state until session closes (tab closes) using browser's session-storage. The save button is used to validate and make any additional calls like storing in database or calling other APIs.
